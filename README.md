# Wiki

Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia developed using Python (Django), HTML, CSS and Java Script.



Entries are stored using the markup language call **Markdown**. Read through [GitHub’s Markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to get an understanding for how Markdown’s syntax works.

The [python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) package is used to convert the Markdown content to HTML.
